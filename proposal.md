# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *libCEED*

libCEED is a software library primarily oriented towards the efficient solving
of PDEs using the Finite Element Method, specifically those of high order
accuracy. It's framed as a way to allow efficient computing of these methods
across a wide variety of different hardware platforms while retaining the same
code (ie. setup your problem and have it run optimized on different hardware).
The primary audience is those using high order FEM and want to extend their
code for better usage on different hardware.
